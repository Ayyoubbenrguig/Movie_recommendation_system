# MovieLens Dataset for Movie Recommendation System

## Summary
The MovieLens dataset, provided by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota, is a rich resource for developing movie recommendation systems. This dataset includes 100,000 ratings from 943 users across 1,682 movies, with each user rating at least 20 movies. Alongside ratings, basic demographic information (age, gender, occupation, and zip code) is available for each user, offering a foundation for personalized recommendation models.

### Dataset Specifications:
- **Ratings**: 100,000 ratings on a 1-5 scale
- **Users**: 943 unique users, each with at least 20 rated movies
- **Movies**: 1,682 unique movies with metadata

### Data Collection Period
Data was collected through the MovieLens website between September 19, 1997, and April 22, 1998. Users with fewer than 20 ratings or incomplete demographic information were excluded to ensure data quality.

## File Descriptions
The dataset files include ratings, user demographics, and movie information:

- **u.data**: Contains all ratings with fields for `user_id | item_id | rating | timestamp`.
- **u.info**: Summarizes the number of users, items, and ratings.
- **u.item**: Details for each movie (`movie_id | title | release date | genres`).
- **u.user**: Contains demographic data (`user_id | age | gender | occupation | zip`).
- **u.genre** and **u.occupation**: Define the available genres and occupations.

### Cross-Validation Sets
For model training and testing, 80%/20% splits are provided in files like `u1.base` and `u1.test`. Additionally, **ua** and **ub** splits ensure exactly 10 ratings per user in the test set.
